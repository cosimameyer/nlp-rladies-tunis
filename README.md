## About the talk

Text data provides an oasis of information for both researchers and non-researchers alike to explore. Natural Language Processing (NLP) helps to make sense of this data type. The talk will give you a smooth introduction to the quanteda package [quanteda package](https://quanteda.io/). I will also showcase some visualizations of the results as well as supervised and unsupervised approaches in NLP. As part of a code demo, we will use text [data from the UN](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/0TJX8Y) as a working example to give you first insights into the structure of text data and how to work with it.
